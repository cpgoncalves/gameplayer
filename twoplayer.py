Two-player game analyzer for two player games using Strategy Analyzer

The software model imports a two-person game matrix from Excel and 
performs the following analyses:
    1. Finds the pure strategies Nash equilibria for the simultaneous game
    2. Analyzes two sequential games alternatives
    3. Calculates the probability scenarios in case of a single mixed
       strategy equilibrium
